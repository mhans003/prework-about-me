                I am a 31-year-old primary school educator who has been in education for 8 years. A bit over a year ago, I finsihed my administrative credential and have participated in leadership roles at my school site. I have been long facing that internal question of, "Is this REALLY what I want to be doing?" 

                I have been truly learning web development and coding in general since 2014, which is not long after I began teaching. Since then, I have completed two certification programs (one through UCR Extension and one through MSJC) in web development and programming, respectively. Since the completion of these two programs, I have continued my self-learning journey through making small math applications, learning newer technologies including Node.js and Mongodb, which have allowed me to synthesize my smaller projects into deployed applications. 

                I am excited to start this long-awaited journey in finally making this career transition by taking a true "bootcamp" experience that will help me to "put it all together" and propel myself forward into a new industry!

                I grew up in Murrieta, CA. For small periods of time during my college years, I had lived in San Francisco, Ventura County, and Riverside.

                Aside from learning to program, I have had some hobbies which I fluctuate spending time on, including hiking, photography (some of which I have printed on canvas), and cooking. I also enjoy going to the gym and lap swimming.

                My ideal job would be to either become a freelancer or work for a company which allows me to work remotely and travel around the world. In the long run, I can see myself working either in front-end or back-end development. As far as industry specifics, I am open to many. Ideally, I would love be programming for companies that center on my own hobbies, including photogrpahy or the wellness industry. I have also envisioned working in online curriculum development and educational software in order to utilize my expertise in education and programming math tools.

                There is something about programming and web development that has inticed me for a long time. When I was a teenager, I used to dabble in using Game Maker software. My favorite part of this was sprite development, map creation, and animation of sprite objects. Throughout college, I kept going back to researching this field, and eventually gave into my temptations and curiosity by enrolling in UCR Extension's Web Development certificate program. I have only grown more interested and engaged ever since!
